"""
Distributed Parallel Triangle Counting using Greedy Modularity Communities.
This approach partitions the graph using Clauset-Newman-Mooreâ€™s greedy modularity maximization. 
It prioritizes forming dense internal communities quickly, 
which often results in lower mirror counts and strong intra-community triangle locality.
Despite being faster than Louvain, it still incurs significant preprocessing time,
and tends to form a small number of large communities, which may cause load imbalance and hinder scalability.
